 * Tests that operate with instantiated QML components, yet don't really need Application Window to be created
 * That will produce a lot of warnings, UI utilities such as mouseClick won't work, but the test code becomes simpler
 * and runs faster
 * And if you do want to operate on the muse level, you can get almost there via e.g. triggering clicked(null) signal handler
